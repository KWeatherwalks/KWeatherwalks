# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kevin 
I'm a mathematics enthusiast who likes to build things.  
I'm also eager to begin a career in tech.  
I like data science and statistics. If you're a data-sci learner and need some help with understanding the math in these areas, I can help!  
Reach out to me on Twitter [@kweatherwalks](https://twitter.com/kweatherwalks)  
I'm always learning and I want to help others learn more too.

### Problem Solving
I like solving math and coding problems on Project Euler and Hacker Rank

## Personal Projects
I want to build
- an android app that tracks and guides my home exercise routine (100pushups, 200situps, 200squats challenges)
