# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kevin 
I'm a mathematics enthusiast who likes to build things.  
I'm also eager to begin a career in tech.  
I like data science and statistics. If you're a data-sci learner and need some help with understanding the math in these areas, I can help!  
Reach out to my on Twitter [@kweatherwalks](https://twitter.com/kweatherwalks)  
I'm always learning and want to help others learn more too.


## Personal Projects
I want to build
