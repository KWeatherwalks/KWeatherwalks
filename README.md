# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kevin 
I'm a mathematics enthusiast who likes to build things.  Currently enrolled in Lambda School's DS22 data science cohort.  
Eager to begin a career using tech for good.  
I like data science and statistics. If you're a data-sci learner and need some help with understanding the math in these areas, I can help!  
Reach out to me on Twitter [@kweatherwalks](https://twitter.com/kweatherwalks)  
I'm always learning and I want to help others learn more too.

### Problem Solving
I like solving math and coding problems on Project Euler and Hacker Rank
