# ðŸ‘‹ Hello,ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š
Hi, I'm Kevin! I'm a data scientist with a passion for applying mathematics to difficult problems. I'm eager to begin a career using tech for good.  

- I use `pandas` to explore, wrangle, and analyze data.
- I use `sklearn` to engineer, optimize, and execute machine learning models.
- I use `matplotlib` to create easily interpretable visualizations.


### Problem Solving Communities
I like solving math and coding problems.

### Math help
I like to help people learn data science topics. If you're a data-sci learner and need some help with understanding the math in these areas, I can help!    
I'm always learning and I want to help others learn as well.
